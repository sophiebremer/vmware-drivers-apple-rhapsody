------
This driver provides an implementation of the vmmouse protocol used when
running inside a VMware virtual machine.

With this driver you can get rid of the jumpy PS2 mouse inside a VMware virtual
machine. It further enables the automatic ungrabbing of the mouse when reaching the border of the virtual machines window. Automatic grabbing of the cursor can't be enabled using this driver as it requires an appropriate display driver which uses the hardware mouse cursor provided by the vmware display driver.


Installation
------------
To install the driver simply double click the VMMouse.config directory to 
launch Configure.app. 
After that use Configure.app to add the driver as active mouse driver and 
configure the desktop layout to match the one resulting from the chosen display 
settings (in most cases x and y offset will be zero and the width and the height will be the same ones as in the display settings).

Attention:
Ensure that the setting "vmmouse.present" in the virtual machine configuration file isn't set to "FALSE" or the driver won't work.


Legal
-----
The driver is based on the sources of the vmmouse driver available under GPL in the xorg X11 server (cvs.freedesktop.org:/cvs/xorg/xf86-input-vmmouse). They are also contained in the support directory.

It further relies on parts of the darwin kernel sources (v 0.1) provided by the darwin project of apple under the AFPL (EventSrcPCPointer, PCPointer).
