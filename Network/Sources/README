This is a driver for the vmx network hardware provided by VMware. I wrote it 
to get network working with VMware after version 5.0. 

The code is based on the sources for the linux drivers provided by vmware which is included in the package vmxnet-only.tar.gz which can be found in the ISO-image of the tools cd shipped with every VMware product.

As I never planned to submit this driver anywhere or to make it public documentation of the source code is rather sparse.

INSTALLATION
------------
Simple install it using Configure.app. Currently only one network interface
